This project provides a simple AI MVP that performs:

Text Summarization

Question Answering (Extractive QA)

Users can input their own text or select from a custom dataset (JSONL corpus).

Models are free and run locally via HuggingFace Transformers.

The app is deployable via Streamlit or Gradio, and can later be extended with APIs, PDF input, and RAG retrieval.
